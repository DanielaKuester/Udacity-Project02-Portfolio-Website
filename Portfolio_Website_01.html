  3. a footer with links to my (very few) social media accounts (GitHub, Codepen,
  freeCodeCamp, LinkedIn, Xing)
  4. Maybe, but only **maybe** a navigation bar.
  5. A little "about"-section with text and an SVG-avatar.
  *** I am not sure whether I'll also include placeholder links/dead links
  to Twitter and Facebook. I don't have any business profiles there yet. ***

              <p class="featured__description">Languages and language learning are a part of my life since many years. I am a native speaker of German, but I improved my English and French at university. In my free time, I'm always learning new languages (at the moment, it's Italian). Sometimes I make jokes about learning to program: Actually I'm just doing what was always doing. I'm learning new languages. This time, they are not natural but formal languages like HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript and they are a bit more logical than most of the natural languages. That is the only difference. ;-)</p>
