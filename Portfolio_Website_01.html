    2) a "featured work" section: thumbnails/links to my Codepen/GitHub Account
  3. a footer with links to my (very few) social media accounts (GitHub, Codepen,
  freeCodeCamp, LinkedIn, Xing)
  4. Maybe, but only **maybe** a navigation bar.
  5. A little "about"-section with text and an SVG-avatar.
  *** I am not sure whether I'll also include placeholder links/dead links
  to Twitter and Facebook. I don't have any business profiles there yet. ***
