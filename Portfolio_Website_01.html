						<p class="featured__description">
							<a target="_blank" href="https://codepen.io/danielakuester/full/bMWZqp/">My first little Udacity project</a>
							was a mere exercise in HTML.
							I had to format a pre-written article with the help of HTML. To be honest, I did not really like the "pure" HTML style, so I took a little bit of time to change the font,
							to add a margin and to justify the text with CSS. The result? The article does not have the style of a website from the 1990s any more - and I like that waaay better. ;)
							What I like most about the article itself? I think that it is well-written, I like the Gif-image of the Go board with the Udacity logo and I love that it mentions IBM's AI Watson.
							I was a working student at IBM in the PR department of the "Hochschulprogramme" (German for "University Programs") for nearly one year and I discovered my passion for programming
							there. I had to research websites that teach teenagers to code - and during the process, I fell in love with coding! :)

						<p class="featured__description">The second Udacity project was to create an
							<a target="_blank" href="https://codepen.io/danielakuester/full/WMezea/">animal trading card</a>
							with my favourite animal and to style it with CSS. My favourite animals are
							cats and tortoises, but I think that squirrels look incredibly cute so I simply couldn't resist - I just had to make my card about squirrels! The animal trading card was a lot of
							fun! I learned a lot about squirrels and even more about CSS! <strong>Fun fact:</strong> I was on holidays in Stockholm (Sweden) a few years ago and a little squirrel probably thought that I
							had hamstered a bit of food. It stood about four inches away from my feet, looked at me and I looked back. I couldn't believe how near it came to me and then suddenly it jumped
							and held on my t-shirt! (I even have a photo that proves it.) Since that "attack", squirrels also count to my favourite animals.

						<p class="featured__description">The third Udacity project includes my first babysteps in JavaScript. For the
							<a target="_blank" href="https://codepen.io/danielakuester/full/rpbmQw/">Pixel art maker</a>,
							the task was to program a function that creates a grid with a size that the user can specify. The user can choose a colour with the inbuilt colour-picker and then click a square
							in the grid to colour it. By double-clicking a square, the colour is removed and reset to white. It made me extremely happy to see that I could write a simple program in JavaScript.
							I'm planning to update this project in the next few months when my coding abilities grow. I already have some ideas to change the style of the site with CSS and to add a few new functions.
							So, stay tuned! I will probably also add my future projects to
							<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/DanielaKuester">my GitHub account</a>
							- make sure to check it out! ;)

							(English, French and German as a foreign language) in adult education. I love teaching and I am always on the lookout for new methods

						<p class="aboutme__description">Learning and personal development are vital parts of my life. Whenever I have the time to do so, I am striving to learn new things (for example with the help of
							<a target="_blank" href="https://de.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001">Udacity's Front End NanoDegree</a>
							). At the moment, I spend most of my free time with learning to program in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Over time, I want to expand this knowledge to other programming languages
							(PHP, Python, C++, etc.) as well. My dream is to become a full stack web developer and I am working hard to make this dream come true. My fascination with personal devlopment applies to all areas
							of my life. For example, I am extending my comfort zone by playing theatre in an English amateur theatre group at my former university. I hope to join Toastmasters some day so that I can work on
							my rhetorical skills.

						<h3 class="heading">Language Addict</h3>
						<p class="aboutme__description"> I am in love with languages and language learning since many years. I am a native speaker of German, but I improved my English and French at university.
							In my free time, I'm always learning new languages. At the moment, I'm learning Italian every day with Duolingo: Provo a imparare l'italiano. Capisco un po', ma il mio italiano non è veramente bravo.
							Have a look at
							<a target="_blank" href="https://www.duolingo.com/Magnolie01">my Duolingo profile</a>
							if you want to connect with me. :-) Sometimes I make jokes about learning to program: Actually I'm just doing what was always doing. I'm learning new languages. This time,
							they are not natural but formal languages like HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript and they are a bit more logical than most of the natural languages. That is the only difference. ;-)
