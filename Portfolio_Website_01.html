                <p class="featured__description"><a target="_blank" href="https://codepen.io/danielakuester/full/bMWZqp/">My first little Udacity project</a> was a mere exercise in HTML.
                I had to format a pre-written article with the help of HTML. To be honest, I did not really like the "pure" HTML style, so I took a little bit of time to change the font,
                to add a margin and to justify the text with CSS. The result? The article does not have the style of a website from the 1990s any more - and I like that waaay better. ;)
                What I like most about the article itself? I think that it is well-written, I like the Gif-image of the Go board with the Udacity logo and I love that it mentions IBM's AI Watson.
                I was a working student at IBM in the PR department of the "Hochschulprogramme" (German for "University Programs") for nearly one year and I discovered my passion for programming
                there. I had to research websites that teach teenagers to code - and during the process, I fell in love with coding! :)</p>

                <p class="featured__description">The second Udacity project was to create an <a target="_blank" href="https://codepen.io/danielakuester/full/WMezea/">animal trading card</a> with my favourite animal and to style it with CSS. My favourite animals are
                cats and tortoises, but I think that squirrels look incredibly cute so I simply couldn't resist - I just had to make my card about squirrels! The animal trading card was a lot of
                fun! I learned a lot about squirrels and even more about CSS! <strong>Fun fact:</strong> I was on holidays in Stockholm (Sweden) a few years ago and a little squirrel probably thought that I
                had hamstered a bit of food. It stood about four inches away from my feet, looked at me and I looked back. I couldn't believe how near it came to me and then suddenly it jumped
                and held on my t-shirt! (I even have a photo that proves it.) Since that "attack", squirrels also count to my favourite animals.</p>

                <p class="featured__description">The third Udacity project includes my first babysteps in JavaScript. For the <a target="_blank" href="https://codepen.io/danielakuester/full/rpbmQw/">Pixel art maker</a>,
                the task was to program a function that creates a grid with a size that the user can specify. The user can choose a colour with the inbuilt colour-picker and then click a square
                in the grid to colour it. By double-clicking a square, the colour is removed and reset to white. It made me extremely happy to see that I could write a simple program in JavaScript.
                I'm planning to update this project in the next few months when my coding abilities grow. I already have some ideas to change the style of the site with CSS and to add a few new functions.
                So, stay tuned! I will probably also add my future projects to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/DanielaKuester">my GitHub account</a> - make sure to check it out! ;)</p>

                that make learning fun! My newest discovery is the <a target="_blank" href="https://busyteacher.org/">Busy Teacher website</a> that provides tons of valuable resources for teaching English
                as a second language. (No, I am not sponsored by their company, I simply like their helpful products.) The best about this great collection? You can adapt the teaching methods and use them
                to teach other foreign languages as well. I'm really looking forward to making experiments with creative and interesting teaching methods in my German and French classes!</p>

                <p class="aboutme__description">Learning and personal development are vital parts of my life. Whenever I have the time to do so, I am striving to learn new things
                (for example with the help of <a target="_blank" href="https://de.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001">Udacity's Front End NanoDegree</a>). At the moment, I spend
                most of my free time with learning to program in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Over time, I want to expand this knowledge to other programming languages (PHP, Python, C++, etc.) as well. My
                dream is to become a full stack web developer and I am working hard to make this dream come true. My fascination with personal devlopment applies to all areas of my life. For example,
                I am extending my comfort zone by playing theatre in an English amateur theatre group at my former university. I hope to join Toastmasters some day so that I can work on my rhetorical skills.</p>

                <p class="aboutme__description"> I am in love with languages and language learning since many years. I am a native speaker of German, but I improved my English and French at university.
                  In my free time, I'm always learning new languages. At the moment, I'm learning Italian every day with Duolingo: Provo a imparare l'italiano. Capisco un po', ma il mio italiano non è veramente bravo.
                  Have a look at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.duolingo.com/Magnolie01">my Duolingo profile</a> if you want to connect with me. :-)
                  Sometimes I make jokes about learning to program: Actually I'm just doing what was always doing. I'm learning new languages. This time, they are not natural but formal languages like
                  HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript and they are a bit more logical than most of the natural languages. That is the only difference. ;-)</p>
